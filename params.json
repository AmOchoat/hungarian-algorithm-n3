By implementing the priority\r\nqueue with a van Emde Boas tree the time can be\r\nreduced to 𝓞(n³ log log n). The van Emde Boas tree\r\nis possible to use because the elements values are\r\nbounded within the priority queue's capacity.\r\nHowever this implemention achived 𝓞(n³) by not using\r\na priority queue.\r\n\r\nEdmonds and Karp, and independently Tomizawa, has\r\nalso reduced the time complexity to 𝓞(n³), but I\r\ndo not known how.\r\n\r\n","name":"hungarian-algorithm-n3","google":""}
